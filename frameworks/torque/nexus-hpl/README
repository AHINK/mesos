This installation of HPL was used for the OSDI submission of Mesos (named Nexus at the time). It was compiled for large EC2 instances running Ubuntu (Lucid).

The various "X-node" directories contain just the configuration file HPL.dat which adjusts the size of the problem (e.g. the matrix) in order to provide a mixed workload for experiments. Jobs using these conf files can be launched with the corresponding qsub scripts in the /root/nexus/frameworks/torque/ directory. However, first the xhpl executable must be built and then copied into these directories. The xhpl executable can be built using the Make.Linux_PII_CBLAS, which was constructed with to work on this version of ubuntu.

Building for ubuntu (lucid, EC2 ami-id ami-19a14870):
1) download and untar http://nexus.berkeley.edu/hpl-nexus.tar.gz
     NOTE: this package should contain the Makefile we created to build on 
           lucid, which also exists in the same dir as this README
2) in hpl directory, to build hpl binary, run:
     make arch=Linux_PII_CBLAS

Then copy bin/xhpl to the "X-node" directories, and you should be able to launch xhpl jobs of various sizes using qsub commands in root/nexus/frameworks/torque/

TODO:
Dependencies for running hpl on slaves (that should be added to the Mesos cluster deploy scripts):
- libatlas-base-dev
- afortran
